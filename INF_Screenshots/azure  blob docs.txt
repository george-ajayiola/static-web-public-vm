
To get the file URI from an Azure Blob Storage, you need to upload the file to a storage container and then generate the URL for that file. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to upload the file to Azure Blob Storage and retrieve the file URI (URL).

Step-by-Step: Upload and Get File URI from Azure Blob Storage
1. Create a Storage Account
If you don't already have a storage account, you'll need to create one. You can create it using the Azure CLI or Terraform. Hereâ€™s how to create a storage account using Azure CLI:
az storage account create \
  --name postdeploymentvm \
  --resource-group georg-rg \
  --location northeurope \
  --sku Standard_LRS

2. Create a Storage Container
Once the storage account is created, you need to create a storage container where the files (blobs) will be uploaded.
az storage container create \
  --name mycontainer \
  --account-name postdeploymentvm  \
  --public-access blob
az storage blob url \
  --account-name postdeploymentvm \
  --container-name myconntainer\
  --name postdeploy.sh



Query string caching behavior refers to how caching systems (such as Azure Front Door, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and web proxies) handle query strings in URLs when caching resources.

What are Query Strings?
A query string is the part of a URL that contains data in key-value pairs, often used to pass parameters to a web server. It follows a ? and consists of key-value pairs separated by &.
